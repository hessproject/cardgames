This is an in progress repository to build a card game engine in Java. It began on 10/8/15 and I work on it in my spare time.

My goal is to make the base classes reusable across as many types of card games as possible, from poker to blackjack to solitaire. I also plan to build a GUI to select a game and make as many of these card games playable as I can.
